Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins

1 cup sugar
1 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking powder
pinch of nutmeg
pinch of clove
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1 2/3 cups flour

1 cup chocolate chips (I used milk chocolate)

2 eggs
1/2 cup (1 stick) melted butter
1 cup pumpkin

Pre-heat oven to 350^F.

Place all of the dry ingredients except the chocolate chips in a large bowl. Thoroughly mix then stir in the chocolate chips.

In a separate bowl, mix the wet ingredients.

Quickly fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. It doesn't need to be perfect, any remaining flour lumps will bake out in the oven. Scoop the batter (it will be very stiff, practically like cookie dough) into muffin tins and bake on the middle rack of the oven for 20-25 minutes.
