Eggnog

<pre>
12 eggs, separated
1 pound sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1 quart heavy cream
cinnamon
nutmeg
rum or bourbon
</pre>

Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks.
In a 2nd bowl, beat the sugar with the yolks until yellow and ribbony and quickly stir in vanilla.
Fold egg yolk mixture into the egg whites.
Beat the cream until stiff and fold into sugar egg mixture.
Gently fold in the desired amount of rum or bourbon (up to a full 750 works) and season the top with cinnamon and nutmeg.
Ladle into cups and serve with spoons.


Notes:
If the egg whites and cream were stiff enough, you shouldn't be able to pour this, but you will need to scoop it instead.
Duck eggs make this even richer.
Leftovers make excellent French Toast.
