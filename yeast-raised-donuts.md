Mixing:

1. In a container, combine milk, water, and yeast. Mix to dissolve yeast and set aside.
2. In a mixing bowl combine the butter, sugar, salt. Beat with a wooden spoon until light and creamy. Add the eggs and beat until well blended.
3. Add the milk, water, and yeast mixture to the creamed mixture and blend.
4. Add the half the flour and stir with a wooden spoon to blend the ingredients together. Add the remaining flour and stiruntil the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl
5. Turn the dough onto a un-floured surface and knead until it is smooth, elastic and doesn't stick to the surface.
6. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover in plastic wrap, and ferment for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until doubled.
7. After dough has doubled, uncover and turn on to a lightly floured surface. Fold the dough 1/3rd from the bottom to the top of the dough. Fold the top edge to the bottom edge. Fold 1/3rd of the dough from the right to the left and then fold the left edge to the right edge.
8. Place back in the oiled bowl and ferment for 30 to 45 minutes or until doubled.

Pre-heat oil to 375 degrees

Rolling and Cutting:
1. Lightly flour the work surface and turn out the dough from the bowl.
2. Lightly flour the top of the dough and pat out with the flats of your hands.
3. With a rolling pin roll the dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Flouring the surface if necessary.
4. With a donut cutter cut out the donut rounds and holes. Place on a lightly flour surface to proof for 30 minutes. Leave uncovered so the surface of the donut develops a skin.
5. To make filled doughnuts cut out the shape (round, square, rectangle) and proof for 30 minutes. Leave uncovered so the surface develops a skin.
6. The scrap dough can be cut into irregular pieces, proofed and fried. Do not attempt to rework the dough as it will become tough.

Frying and Finishing:

1. To fry donuts, carefully lower 3 to 4 proofed pieces of dough into hot fat skin side down. Do not crowd the frying pot.
2. Fry the donuts on the first side for 30-45 seconds or until light brown. With tongs or a long chop stick turn the donuts over and fry on the second side for 20-30 seconds or until golden brown.
3. Remove from the fryer and drain on a cooling rack that has been placed over a sheet tray.
4. Glaze with sugar while still warm or cool completely to fill and top with ganache.
